    "[Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) started in 2015 on the basis of `IPython` (Interactive Python).\n",
    "Since then, they have become quite popular within the Data Science community, since they allow to mix code, documentation and presentation of results in one place.\n",
    "For example, there are Jupyter Notebooks about the first observation of gravitational waves and the discovery of a supermassive black-hole available on GitHub.\n",

    "\n",

    "Cells contain either descriptive text in Markdown format, like this cell, or executable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code cells are executed by a *Kernel*, which runs in the background.\n",
    "The Kernel reads and evaluates the code and prints the result back into the Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "As long as the kernel is running (alive), it keeps its memory, which allows you to carry over variables and definitions between code cells.\n",
